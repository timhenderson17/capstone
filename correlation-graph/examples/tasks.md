DONE + calculate node degree
DONE + use node degree to size node circles
DONE + better labels
DONE + center labels on nodes
DONE + package as node module
DONE + use power scale for link width?
+ add slider control to vary link threshold
+ better tooltips

+ create gravity centers for communities
  "can we pull things of the same colors toward one another"?
  in gephi - force field pulls high correlated nodes close to one another
  then modularity calculation assigns color labels to similar nodes

+ on select highlight links of selected node - @mattd
+ be able to pin nodes
+ on select, show a tooltip with node names and correlation values for all nodes correlated with the selected node, above some correlation value threshold - @ashrith

+ annotate most central nodes or nodes that have the highest correlations (the most correlations above the threshold?)
